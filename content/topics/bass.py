One of the main injections of new music was learning an instrument.
Each of the tutors I had would try to mix in skill-appropriate songs and riffs, largely from the discographies of muse, rage against the machine, or RHCP.
The latter didn't quite stick for me, but the other two are fun.

Once I'd comfortable picked it up, I started looking around for bands that featured bass heavily. At some points I had to pick out songs to play for assessments, so I'd go hunting for riffs for fun, technicality, and novelty.

A few bands that appeared a few times from that are:
- Tool. The Pot, Schism, Sober, Forty Six & 2, and many more
- Muse, again. I played Hysteria for an assessment once and never again
- two man drummer + bassist bands like DFA and Royal Blood. Trainwreck 1979 or Out of the Black, respectively
- Primus. The usual suspects like John The Fisherman, plus Lacquer Head and most of the Antipop album. Les seems to get all the love but the rest of the band are great too.
