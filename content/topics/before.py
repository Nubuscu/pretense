BODY = """
Like most people, my taste in music was formed initially from what I heard around me.
On one side, Mum had CCM like Hillsong, some Bon Jovi, ABBA, and Shania Twain (too much Shania).
On the other, Dad had some Creed, Green Day, that one Evanescence album, and I think Avril Lavigne at some point.

I think I gravitated towards the riffs from Dad's side, and thus began a lifelong quest for heavier music.

As I got a little older, I started wanting to buy more music, but that was restricted by a couple of things:
1. CDs were expensive in kid terms
2. It had to be Christian, or at least known by the parents and given the okay. The former was an easier sell.

Some of it's worth a revisit. Some.
