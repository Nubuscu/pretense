One of the complaints about metal I hear from non-fans seems to be the harsh vocals.
Or whatever you want to call it. Screaming, extreme vocals, gutturals, growls, pig squeals, etc. Not clean singing.

For me, it was an acquired taste, and not all vocalists are the same.
I can't say I catch every word that's said but I don't exactly do that with things that get radio play anyway.
At least to begin, I just considered vocals to be another instrument, and I was mostly listening for those anyway. Hearing the lyics came later.

In a similar vein, there's a lot of nuanced, pretty tones you can get from a clean guitar that distortion blows away.
Sure, there's some loss of clarity but that's an artistic choice. I'd argue that screams are more emotive.

Awakened was _the_ album that got me into metalcore. A Greater Foundation was where I started, so that might be a good place to start too.
Triptych era DH is kinda just shouty with some clean vocals, so that's fairly easy to understand.
Or any hard(er) rock where there's a screamed bridge or harsh backing vocals. TFK does this a bit
