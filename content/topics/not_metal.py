weirdly, there's a few things in the collection that aren't metal.

The pipeline for getting here is basically
1. Learn to play a few rage against the machine songs
1. Stumble upon a Zack de le Rocha feature on a Run The Jewels album
1. See a Fantano video on Death Grips and try out Exmilitary
1. Let the various recommendation engines do the rest

I tend towards stuff with good beats/production and complex or funny lyricism.
Some of the more abrasive beats border on the fuzzy, hardcore punk elements of other things I like.

e.g.
- anything RTJ - 2 and 3 are my favourites. El-P's solo stuff is good too
- Danny Brown - Ain't it Funny
- Death Grips - Exmilitary (the EP is a free download), particularly Takyon
