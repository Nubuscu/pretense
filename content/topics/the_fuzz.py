BODY = """
Overdrive, distortion, and fuzz are all (typically) guitar effects along the same spectrum - push more signal through the amplifier than you should and see what it does.
Now that it's an established pattern, there's plenty of amps built for it or pedals to accomplish the same effect.

There's plenty of overlap but in general, overdrive is relatively tasteful, distortion is aggressive, and fuzz is anywhere between a wall of noise and pretending to be a synthesizer.

It crops up in slower, doom or stoner rock/metal subgenres for the former and electronic-heavy subgenres for the latter.

Recommendations:
- The whole Mutants album, start with Demons.
- Muse - Hysteria, obviously
- Karnivool - Goliath, Darkglass made a pedal out of that tone.
- Conan - Volt Thrower
