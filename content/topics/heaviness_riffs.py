In my quest to overanalyze music, we get to riffs.

> BBC Radio 2, in compiling its list of 100 Greatest Guitar Riffs, defined a riff as the "main hook of a song", often beginning the song, and is "repeated throughout it, giving the song its distinctive voice".

For me, this was the segue from radio-friendly rock to heavier variations.
The sign of a good riff is that when you think of the song, you can hear the riff in your head.

Examples:
- Chevelle - Hats off to the bull
- Meshuggah - Do not look down
- Maylene and the sons of disaster - Step up
- DFA 1979 - Trainwreck 1979
