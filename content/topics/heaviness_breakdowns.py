BODY = """
Breakdowns are more-or-less the sticking point of modern metalcore/deathcore.
For the uninitiated, it's usually a bridge or outro part where the band plays a lower, slower, or stripped-back riff and gives the crowd an excuse to mosh.

An unlikely example is the outro of Muse's Stockholm Syndrome

more likely examples:
- Anything Knocked Loose do. Counting Worms is a classic, Everything is Quiet Now is good too.
- Phinehas' I Am The Lion
