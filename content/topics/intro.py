I like music and I didn't think the internet had enough faceless opinions on subjective matter, so here we are.

This project is as much for my own interest as it is anyone who might stumble across it.
It's a way to grapple with what I listen to, how my tastes have evolved over time, what discoveries were made when, etc.
There might be a few recommendations but this is mostly me writing to myself.

When someone asks what kind of music you like, there's only one incorrect answer - "A little bit of everything".
I can guarantee that there's some combination of Tiny Tim, Nails, <insert CCM or pop-country>, or Death Grips that you're not immediately a fan of.
That said, I mostly listen to metal these days..
