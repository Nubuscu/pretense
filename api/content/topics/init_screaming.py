TITLE = "Screaming is just noiseâ„¢"

BODY = """
The X CDs gave me a bit of exposure to harsh vocals, but not too much.
Most of the music I'd discovered so far was via CDs, which the parents bought.
As such, their preference for not-screaming was accounted for, so I didn't seek them out until later on

The main arguments against them seems to be:
- I don't like the sounds. Valid.
- It's unclear what they're saying. Partially true, depending on the vocalist.
- It's just noise. See the Jared Dines video getting random strangers to metal scream.

For me, it was a somewhat aquired taste, mostly the first point.
I found songs where I liked the music, and the vocals were something I tolerated.
First, a few songs that had a screamed bridge.
Then, one song that's screamed out of an album I liked.
Then, an album of half-sung half-yelled vocals.
Then, a friend introduces me to As I Lay Dying.
After a while, I got used to it, and they became more understandable.

Recommended listening:
- Bridge Burning, White Limo from Wasting Light
- Just A Shock from III
- (the intro and) Not I from The Triptych
- Meddler from Constellations (This was on X 2010, didn't really get into the album until much later on)
- A Greater Foundation from Awakened, or any of it really.
