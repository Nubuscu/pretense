I like music and I didn't think the internet had enough faceless opinions on subjective matter, so here we are.
This project is as much for my own interest as it is anyone who might stumble across it.
It's a way to grapple with what I listen to, how my tastes have evolved over time, what discoveries were made when, etc.

When someone asks what kind of music you listen to, there's only one incorrect answer - "A little bit of everything".
I can guarantee that there's some combination of Tiny Tim, Nails, <insert CCM or pop-country>, or Death Grips that you're not immediately a fan of.

Some grounding opinions and factoids:
- I am just some guy:tm: with opinions. Yours are just as valid.
- my roots are mostly in niche NZ and/or Christian rock, which progressed into Christian metalcore, then a few other varieties of metal
- some mixture of rap, funk, and electronic thrown in along the line
- being exact about subgenres is often silly but sometimes helpful. I don't think lyrical content constitues a genre.

Some things I seem to keep recommending to people are attached here.
