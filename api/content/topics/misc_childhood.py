BODY = """
This is the grab-bag of everything that was parentally approved that I listened to while I was young enough to need to run it past Mum or Dad before buying.
While that sounds a bit negative, there's some genuinely worthwile music in there.
Would I go back? maybe not. I re-listened to a bit of each album while writing this and died inside a few times.
Was it important to me in some capacity? yes.

I find Christian music (outside of what's played in a church service) falls into two categories
1. By Christians, for Christians. The times where name dropping Jesus takes on more weight than the musicality. Probably what that King of the Hill joke was aimed at
1. The kind where you look it up later and find out they're a Christian band. Faith is coincidental and the music doesn't suffer for it.

I'll try to point at the interesting bits.
