TITLE = "An Investigation Into Perceived Heaviness"


BODY = """
The quest for heavier music seems to be the main driving force for my musical exploration.
What that actually means, I'm hoping to explore a bit more.

At first, it was anything with a decent riff. I got into TobyMac from family, and gravitated towards a few tracks with guitar work and some riffs.

Then Skillet happened. We all make mistakes.

the one thing I can't find online is these X: 20xx CD's that we bought (09, 10, and 11) which had a mix of Christian rock/metal artists.
these were my intro to Thousand Foot Krutch, House of Heroes, Demon Hunter, and Underoath to name a few.

TFK are worth mentioning for showing younger me that energetic riffs and loud noises can go along with melodic choruses.
Also for an interview with the bassist where he talks about (like Shavo from SOAD's "meat and potatoes") not overplaying and serving the song.
A comment that would stick with me for a while.

Between the X CDs and MATSOD, harsh vocals were _around_, although not really something I enjoyed thus far.

Recommended listening for the quick(er) version:
- Boomin' and Ignition from Portable Sounds (Feelin' So Fly is fun too)
- Drown from The End Is Not The End
- E for Exctinction from Welcome To The Masquerade
- the first 3 tracks from The Flame In All Of Us
- Step Up (I'm on it) and Oh Lonely Grave from III
