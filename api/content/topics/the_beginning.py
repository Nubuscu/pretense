TITLE = "In the Beginning"

BODY = """
I'm fairly sure everyone's musical tastes start with what they're exposed to via their close family as a kid.
I was born a bit prem, so the nurses told my parents to play the radio to emulate the background noise of the ward to help me sleep.
In that sense, there was always some kinda of musical noise around, even if I didn't really comprehend it at the time.
One thing to note is that I grew up in a Christian household so there was always some attention paid to keep the "bad" stuff away.
Which is understandable for any child, really, but I learned that Christian bands (and radio) were categorically okay. 
Anything else was critiqued more thoroughly, although I distinctly remember being asked whether I listen to "the music or the words".
I answered "the music", and a week or so later we owned Green Day's American Idiot and _that_ Evanescence album.

So the categories were:
1. Things Mum liked from the before times (Abba, Bon Jovi)
1. Things Dad liked from the before times ("angry young man music" that got lost in a move once)
1. Christian radio (yes we had one, Life FM. Rhema sucked)
1. vetted new-ish releases. (Creed, Shania Twain for some reason, Avril Lavigne)

I went back to the couple of Creed albums semi-recently, and they're still good. If nothing else, Tremonti's guitar work holds up.
