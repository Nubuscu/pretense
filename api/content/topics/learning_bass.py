TITLE = "Learning Bass"

BODY = """
I was encouraged to pick up Piano by relatives that played, which I did for a few years.
Arriving at the conclusion that none of the bands I liked used piano, I decided to try my hand a guitar.
At the time I was taking group lessons (10ish kids doing the same tired riffs round the room, eventually going to schools to perform them).
By the simple fact that I had the biggest hands, I was given a bass guitar, thought it was more fun, and it stuck.
I carried on with a couple of one-on-one tutors and played through most of high school.

That all had a couple of follow-on effects:
1. Bands I like have bassists, which means there are tabs on the internet
1. I was learning via riffs and songs, being exposed to a few new things
1. I learned to appreciate impressive playing

Every tutor I had loved RHCP, RATM, and/or Muse - their bassists are always doing something interesting.
RHCP was fun but didn't stick as much as the other two for me.
Rage were more-or-less my intro to politically charged music (or at least, overtly charged). A good chunk of the lyrics become unfortunately more relevant as time goes on
Muse showed me you can have effects on bass. Doesn't sound like much, but they're relatively rare. The tones on Hysteria or Stockholm Syndrome led me down a rabbit hole of fuzzy noises.

At which point, I started looking for bands where bass takes a more centre-stage role and landed on Tool, Death From Above, and Royal Blood.
The latter two are two-man bands (bass + drums), so there's a lot of distortion and fun effects that I'd been searching for after Muse.
Justin Chancellor is the reason I found Tool initially but Maynard is immense in his own right, and I'd soon find his other projects.
